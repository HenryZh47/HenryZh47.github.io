## Introduction
This is a capstone project for robotics additional major students at Carnegie Mellon University. Our team (Team DeepBlockchainAI lol) decided to build a driveway cleaning robot. We spent the first semester doing system engineering, and then build the system in the following semester. Thanks to the great team work with Hans, Spencer, and Xueting, we have the system fulfilling the requirements by the end of the year. You can find the relative system engineering documents, and final demo video in this article.

## System Engineering Documents
The system engineering documents include a system requirement document, a concept design document, a verification and validation plan, and a detail design document. We also did prototyping to prove concepts.
